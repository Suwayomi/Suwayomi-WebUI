## Hold up!
If you got here hoping to download Suwayomi-WebUI, go back and download [Tachidesk-Server](https://github.com/Suwayomi/Tachidesk-Server), Suwayomi-WebUI is distributed as an embedded web interface along with Tachidesk-Server.

# Suwayomi-WebUI
WebUI doesn't have it's own Tachidesk distribution and is version locked by Tachidesk-Server, In other words the Suwayomi-WebUI distribution is actually the Tachidesk-Server distribution.

Online builds of WebUI of are always available [here](https://suwayomi-webui-preview.github.io/). 
*Make sure to set your Tachidesk-Server hostname in Settings or you'll get infinite loading.* Also note that its the **latest** revision of WebUI and might not work correctly if you connect to a stable build of Tachidesk-Server.

You can find minified builds of WebUI in [Suwayomi-WebUI-preview](https://github.com/Suwayomi/Suwayomi-WebUI-preview)
