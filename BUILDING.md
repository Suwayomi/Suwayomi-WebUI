# Getting Started with Create React App

This project is built with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn dev`

This command runs the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page reloads when you make edits.\
Lint errors also appear in the console.

### `yarn preview`

This command runs the app in a local preview production build.

### `yarn build`

This command optimizes the production build of the app and places it in the `build` folder.
It also bundles React in production mode to ensure the best performance.
After that, the build is minified, and the filenames include the hashes.\
With that, the app is ready to be deployed!

See this section about [Building for Production](https://vitejs.dev/guide/build.html) for more information.
